readme_content = """# 🌸 Wofi Config – Purple Haze Edition  

This is my **custom Wofi launcher** setup designed for **Hyprland**.  
The goal was to create a **minimal yet aesthetic menu** with soft transparency and a hacker-like vibe.  

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Purple Haze theme** – translucent background with a violet glow  
- 🪟 **Barely opaque transparency** for a clean look over wallpapers  
- ⌨️ **Vim-like navigation** (after hitting `ESC`)  
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** – no lag, instant launch  
- 🛠️ Designed to integrate seamlessly with **Hyprland**
