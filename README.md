🌸 Wofi Config – Purple Haze Edition  

This is my **custom Wofi launcher** setup designed for **Hyprland**.  
The goal was to create a **minimal yet aesthetic menu** with soft transparency and a hacker-like vibe.  
(It's still in progress.. so that's all)

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Purple Haze theme** – translucent background with a violet glow  
- 🪟 **Barely opaque transparency** for a clean look over wallpapers  
- ⌨️ **Vim-like navigation** (after hitting `ESC`)  
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** – no lag, instant launch  
- 🛠️ Designed to integrate seamlessly with **Hyprland**

## 🔧 Installation
though I don't know why you want it.. it's not so good still:
Clone into your config directory:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veles-venice/Dot-Files.git
cd Dot-Files/wofi
